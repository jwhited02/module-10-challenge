Module 10 Challenge - Advanced SQL

For this challenge I was tasked with analyzing the climate of Honolulu, Hawaii and then creating a climate app as well. 

The csv files and the sqlite file can be found in the "Resources" folder. 

The .ipynb file containing the analysis can be found in the "Analysis" folder. 

The python file containing the code for the app can be found in the "App" folder. 

I found the starter code extremely helpful in giving me a layout of how this was to be completed, without that I probably would have been pretty lost. 

As for the analysis, it was pretty straight forward in terms of similarities to class activities. 

The class activity about Flask was a great resource for part 2 of this challenge which was designing the climate app. I was able to go off of that and create the app without many issues. 

Overall, I am pretty happy with how this challenge turned out and I hope it is what you are looking for.

Thank you for taking the time to grade my assignment!
