Module 10 Challenge - Advanced SQL

For this challenge I was tasked with analyzing the climate of Honolulu, Hawaii and then creating a climate app as well. 

I found the starter code extremely helpful in giving me a layout of how this was to be completed, without that I probably would have been pretty lost. 

As for the analysis, it was pretty straight forward in terms of similarities to class activities. 

The class activity about Flask was a great resource for part 2 of this challenge which was designing the climate app. I was able to go off of that and create the app without many issues. 

Overall, I am pretty happy with how this challenge turned out and I hope it is what you are looking for!

Thank you for taking the time to grade my assignment!
