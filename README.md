# Module 10 Challenge - Advanced SQL

For this challenge, I was tasked with analyzing the climate of Honolulu, Hawaii, and creating a climate app.

- **Resources**: The CSV files and the SQLite file can be found in the "Resources" folder.
- **Analysis**: The .ipynb file containing the analysis can be found in the "Analysis" folder.
- **App**: The Python file containing the code for the app can be found in the "App" folder.

## Analysis
The starter code was extremely helpful in providing a layout for the task. Without it, I might have been quite lost. The analysis was straightforward due to its similarities to class activities.

## App Development
The class activity about Flask was a great resource for starting part 2 of this challenge, which involved designing the climate app. Once I got to the Start and Start and End routes it got a little bit trickier, but I was able to figure it out. The major issue I was having was just figuring out that I needed to replace the <start> and <end> with the actual dates when I was typing in the URL to check it, which made me feel pretty dumb. With that being said, here are the links to each route's URL:

## Routes
The URLs for each route in the climate app are as follows:

- **Precipitation**: [http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1.0/precipitation](http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1.0/precipitation)
- **Stations**: [http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1.0/stations](http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1.0/stations)
- **TOBS**: [http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1.0/tobs](http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1.0/tobs)
- **Start Date**: [http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1.0/2017-01-01](http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1.0/2017-01-01)
- **Start and End Date**: [http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1.0/2017-01-01/2017-01-07](http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1.0/2017-01-01/2017-01-07)

## Conclusion
Overall, I am happy with how this challenge turned out and believe it meets the expectations.

Thank you for taking the time to grade my assignment!
