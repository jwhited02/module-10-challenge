Module 10 Challenge - Advanced SQL

For this challenge I was tasked with analyzing the climate of Honolulu, Hawaii and then creating a climate app as well. 

The csv files and the sqlite file can be found in the "Resources" folder. 

The .ipynb file containing the analysis can be found in the "Analysis" folder. 

The python file containing the code for the app can be found in the "App" folder. 

I found the starter code extremely helpful in giving me a layout of how this was to be completed, without that I probably would have been pretty lost. 

As for the analysis, it was pretty straight forward in terms of similarities to class activities. 

The class activity about Flask was a great resource to get started on part 2 of this challenge which was designing the climate app. 

The URL's for each route can be found here:

Precipitation: http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1.0/precipitation
  
Stations: http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1.0/stations
  
TOBS: http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1.0/tobs
  
Start: http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1.0/2017-01-01 
  
Start & End: http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1.0/2017-01-01/2017-01-07
  
  
  
Overall, I am pretty happy with how this challenge turned out and I hope it is what you are looking for.
  
Thank you for taking the time to grade my assignment!
